A handy Chrome plugin for jumping straight to a Jira ticket just by typing the ticket id

Here’s a handy chome plugin I created a while back when I wanted to make accessing jira tickets a bit more efficient. I’m finding it quite useful so I though I’d share it.
If I know the ticket number I don’t want to open up a new tab to load jira then wait for the page to load then put the ticket into the search and then wait for jira to load again. That’s like 2 screen loads, multiple actions and 3 whole seconds wasted (at least) just to see a ticket!
 
With this you can just hit Ctrl+J, type in the ticket number into the box (or paste it in), hit enter, and it opens up a new tab with the ticket.
 
If it sounds like something you’d use you can install it as follows:
 
1. Download the jira_chrome_plugin directory
1. Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions -> Switch on Developer Mode (top right)
1. Click “Load unpacked”
1. Choose the jira_chrome_plugin folder
1. Set the base URL of your jira instance in the plugin settings under Extension Options

That's it!

You can now hit Ctrl-J and a little box should pop up where you can type in the ticket id. Hit Enter and it will open the ticket in a new tab.
 
If you pin the extension in the toolbar you get a little jira icon to click on which also pops up the little box.
